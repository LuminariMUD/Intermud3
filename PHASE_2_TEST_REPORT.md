## Detailed Issue Analysis

### Issue 1: Tell Packet Structure
**Location**: `src/models/packet.py:165`
```python
# Current implementation adds extra 'visname' field
# Should be: [type, ttl, o_mud, o_user, t_mud, t_user, message]
# Actually: [type, ttl, o_mud, o_user, t_mud, t_user, visname, message]
```

### Issue 2: Startup Packet Fields
**Location**: `src/models/packet.py:599`
```python
# Test expects 'mud_port' field
# Model doesn't have this field defined
# Need to add port field to StartupPacket model
```

### Issue 3: Configuration Models
**Location**: `src/config/models.py`
```python
# Using deprecated Pydantic V1 validators
# Need migration to V2 field_validator
# RouterConfig structure doesn't match usage
```

## Performance Analysis

### Achieved Metrics
- **LPC Encoding**: ~5000 packets/sec PASS
- **LPC Decoding**: ~4000 packets/sec PASS
