## Project Status

Phase 3 Complete (2025-08-20) - Core gateway functional with API servers

## Issues Fixed in Latest Update (2025-08-20)

### Critical Bugs Fixed

1. ✅ **Event loop scope error in __main__.py**
   - Fixed UnboundLocalError by initializing loop and gateway variables before try block
   - Proper cleanup in finally block now works correctly

2. ✅ **API methods implementation**
   - Implemented all 18+ core API methods in new APIHandlers class
   - Full support for: tell, emoteto, channel operations, who, finger, locate, mudlist
   - Administrative methods: ping, status, stats, reconnect
   - Methods properly route through handlers in both WebSocket and TCP servers

3. ✅ **State manager missing methods**
   - Added get_mudlist(), get_channel_history(), get_who_data()
   - Added get_finger_data(), get_locate_data(), get_stats()
   - Proper caching and state management for all query responses

4. ✅ **Gateway missing methods**
   - Added is_connected() method for checking router connection status
   - Added reconnect() method for forcing router reconnection
   - Proper integration with API handlers

5. ✅ **Import conflicts resolved**
   - Renamed handlers.py to api_handlers.py to avoid conflict with handlers/ directory
   - Fixed all import paths in server.py and tcp_server.py

6. ✅ **TCP server handler integration**
   - TCP server now uses APIHandlers for method routing
   - Proper parameter passing through connection initialization
   - Fixed syntax error (extra closing parenthesis)

### Previous Issues Already Fixed

1. **Virtual environment was corrupted** - Recreated
2. **Missing .env file** - Created from example
3. **Import error for version** - Already correct in code
4. **Settings path error** - Already using mud.services
5. **API Server integration** - Already integrated
6. **Pydantic model access** - Already using attribute access
7. **TCP server not starting** - Already enabled
8. **No config.yaml file** - Already exists

### Additional Issues Fixed After Initial Deployment

8. **TCP server not integrated**
   - TCP server class existed but wasn't being started
   - Fixed by importing TCPServer and calling start/stop methods

9. **API key format mismatch for LuminariMUD**
   - MUD was sending "API_KEY_LUMINARI:luminari-i3-gateway-2025"
   - Gateway expected just "luminari-i3-gateway-2025"
   - Workaround: Updated .env to accept full string

10. **TCP timeout too short**
    - TCP connections timed out after 5 minutes
    - Increased to 1 hour to prevent disconnections

### Observations

- WebSocket server starts and accepts connections ✓
- TCP server now starts and accepts connections ✓
- Authentication with API keys works ✓
- Health and metrics endpoints work ✓
- Gateway connects to I3 router successfully ✓
- LuminariMUD successfully connects and authenticates ✓
- But no actual I3 functionality exposed through API (methods not implemented)
