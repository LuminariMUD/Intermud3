## Current Sprint Tasks

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 2 Start)
1. [ ] Implement Tell service handler
2. [ ] Implement Channel service handler
3. [ ] Add startup sequence completion
4. [ ] Create service integration tests
5. [ ] Test with live I3 router

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Add proper logging configuration
- [ ] Implement configuration hot-reload
- [ ] Add prometheus metrics export
- [ ] Create Docker container
- [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline

### Documentation Needs
- [ ] Complete API documentation

- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Write deployment guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Notes

- Phase 1 completed successfully with all core infrastructure in place
- Ready to begin Phase 2 service implementations
- Consider setting up test environment with mock router before connecting to production I3 network
- May need to adjust packet structures based on real-world testing with I3 routers
