## Compressed Mode

**Note**: Specification to be filled in with specifics.

Generally, many fields will be replaced with numbers rather than full strings. Some fields can be paired using combined keys. For example:
- `originator_mudname` can be omitted (inferred from TCP session at router)
- Request/reply pairs can use request keys rather than usernames
- User association maintained on originating mud with request key

## Other Drivers/Mudlibs

### Reference Implementations
Two reference implementations exist for the mudlib side of the protocol. These can be ported/used to create implementations for:
- Alternate mudlibs
- MudOS pre-v21 drivers

### Driver Compatibility

#### TCP without MUD-mode
Drivers with TCP but not MUD-mode need to parse incoming transmissions. MUD-mode effectively combines `save_variable()` with standard TCP socket.

#### Without TCP Sockets
Drivers without TCP sockets require a gateway to:
- Hook into the router network
- Gateway protocol between MUD-mode TCP and UDP

### Non-LP Muds
Gateways can be used for non-LP based muds:
- MOO
- MUCK
- Diku
- Others

### Protocol Evolution
Router network protocol can evolve independently of mud protocol, potentially moving away from MUD-mode style communication.
