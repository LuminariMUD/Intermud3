  - Added mud_port, tcp_port, udp_port fields to StartupPacket
  - Fixed packet factory validation logic
  - Migrated configuration to Pydantic V2 (field_validator, ConfigDict)
  - Fixed RouterConfig to use proper nested RouterHostConfig objects
  - Resolved all import errors in integration tests
  - Updated mock router for new packet formats

#### In Progress
